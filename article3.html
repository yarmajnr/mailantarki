            <p>The Mailantarki Care FC emerged as the champions of the 2022 Dana Cup International Youth Championship in Denmark. The Mailantarki lads were the only Nigerian club in that year’s Dana Cup and they produced an all-round unbeaten performance across their fixtures, scoring a record 40 goals.</p>
            <p>Emmanuel Micheal Papo scored the lone goal against Vibar FK of Norway in the final game at Nord Energy Arena Hjørring. Top performers included Miko Dalha, who emerged as the highest goal scorer of the champions for netting 8 times, followed by Abdulazeez Maiyadi and Auwal Abba with seven and six goals, respectively. Another dazzling performer in the tourney was the young sensational playmaker Ibrahim Sani who assisted 12 times with further 3 goals to the bright display.</p>
            <p>Emmanuel Micheal Papo broke the jinx just 3 minutes before time after the Gombe club side’s highest goal scorer, Miko Dalha, set the former on the run inside the Vibar box before firing low beneath the forward-surging goalkeeper in his near post to send the spectators in the Nord Energy Arena into rupture. The goal turned out to be the difference after the Mailantarki goalie, Edward Ameh, came to the rescue earlier with a brilliant finger-tip save to tame a danger from a powerful header by the opponent.</p>
            <p>The contingent were expected in Oslo yesterday for the high-profile Norway Cup 2022 which started today.</p>
